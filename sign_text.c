format("In this challenge you start with 3 random Pokemon and must fight around 200 trainers in a random battle gauntlet. 
You and each trainer have random mons (and moves/abilities if playing with Extra Random). Trainer mon levels are tied to the floor number, with 
Lvl. 5 being the minimum and Lvl. 100 being the max. To start there is only one trainer per floor, 
but as you progress through the Trials more will spawn, with a maximum being four trainers per floor. 
After clearing each floor you will receive two random item drops to aid you on your challenge and then the next floor warp will activate. 
Every 5th floor is a Heal/Shop floor where you will be able to rest and prepare for the next Trial. On every 25th floor, you will have the choice of another random Mon. 
If you do manage to beat the final trainer on Floor 100 you can choose to keep going and see how far you can get. Thats all the info I've got. Hopefully you have fun.")

text PitEntrance_Text_BattleInfo
{
format("This hack is built on a base called the pokeemerald-expansion. By default most later Gen mechanics have been implemented. 
Depending on the version of the Pit that you downloaded this means things like Megas and late Gen Pokemon exist. 
I'm not even really aware of the full extent of these changes as I haven't played all the later games, 
so if you have specific question you can check the Expansion Github to see what changes they have done.")

text PitEntrance_Text_Credits
{
format("I, Archie from Team Aquas Hideout, have put together this romhack. Full credits will be shared with the release but I wanted to include some here. 
All the battle code / late Gen stuff and much more is from the Expansion Team at RHH, they do amazing work. The decomps themselves were created by talented people at pret. 
Nico made the Battle UI. RavePossum implemented the Gen 5 Summary Screen and along with Ruki made the battle bg. Ghoulslash made the Item Desc Code and the UI shell code used for my custom UIs.
Mudskip and I together made the Main Menu / Pokeball Case / Start Menu UIs (Mudskip made the graphics). Jaizu made the Graphics for the Stat Editor (code by me)
Hyo/Poffin made the FRLG style OW sprites. Nicolavs gave me the cave tiles. TheXaman wrote some of the base for randomizer code and the code for the Party Menu (graphics by me). 
Bsbob made the map pop-up branch. Devolov/Rioluwott/EliteRedux/Graion for various QOL additions, mostly battle related.
Special thanks to everyone in our Team Aqua Discord. Game text is slow and there are too many people to thank here, but this hack is built on community resources.
Without all of them this hack would not exist. Thank you all <3")

text PitEntrance_Text_Bugs

format("If you have any Battle related bugs
you can report them on the GitHub for
the pokeemerald-expansion as I have
not changed any Battle Code myself.
Other bugs can be reported in the
Team Aquas Hideout Discord Server.")

text PitEntrance_Text_Cheats
{
format("You can enable the Expansion debug
menu by pressing R and Start at same
time after entering the pit.
These features can break the game
so don't report bugs if using it.")
